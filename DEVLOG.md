# DEVLOG

## Planning and setup
* I started setting by up Maven project and used help of AI to add a repository to existing project.
* I created the necessary project hierarchy.
* I implemented the TestRunner class with assistance from AI to ensure correct JUnit and Cucumber integration.
* I decided to separate the API configuration from the JokeSteps by creating a dedicated ApiConfig class. This ensures the code is maintainable and follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

## Implementation
* I designed one test scenario, carefully analyzing the project requirements to ensure full coverage.
* I implemented the corresponding Java methods for each Gherkin step.
* Following the same path I created the other two feature tests and according steps.
* I performed a final review of the tests, refactoring one of the scenarios to perfectly match the requested values.

## Reporting
* I created text_logs.txt containing logs from the run of final version of my tests.
* I created a README.md file and formatted it.
* I concluded the process by documenting my journey in this DEVLOG file.
